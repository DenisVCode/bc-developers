# Core Module R1 and R2 comparison

We have released the new Core Module 2. Everything is the same, only the flash process is now easier and faster.

With Core R2 you can use the [**BigClown Playground**](https://www.bigclown.com/doc/basics/quick-start-guide/) GUI tool to program nodes, manage radio network and create rules in Node-RED.

## Technical and visual differences

The most significant change is that R2 has only single button. This is the `B` button. It has moved and you can use it for your program. The `R` reset button is not necessary anymore because communication and firmware flashing is now done automatically over **FTDI** chip.
