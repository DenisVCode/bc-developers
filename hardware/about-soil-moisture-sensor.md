# About Soil Moisture Sensor

![Pre-production Soil Moisture Sensor without coating](../.gitbook/assets/_hardware_about-soil-moisture-sensor_module.png)

The **Soil Moisture Sensor** is a modern, completely sealed capacitive moisture sensor with temperature sensor and calibration saved in its internal EEPROM. It is using 1-Wire communication protocol and has 3 wire cable that is 2 meters long. Many sensors can be connected to a single 1-Wire Master. The temperature sensor is located in the top part above the soil. The electronics is completely potted in a sealing compound to withstand all kind of weather.

The sensor returns soil moisture humidity values from 0 to 100%. Measuring is done by two copper strips inside the inner layers of the 4 layer PCB. This way the contacts are not exposed to direct humidity and do not oxidize.

The sensor comes already calibrated. Calibration is done in the water. It is also possible to use sensor to measure water level. 

Sensor is already supported in BigClown SDK with examples and projects. Arduino Library is also [available](https://github.com/podija/SoilSensor).

The sensor is using 1-Wire to I2C converter chip. Behind this converter all the chips are using I2C.

### Soil Sensor Calibration

We calibrate each sensor. The calibration saves data to to internal Soil Sensor EEPROM and ensured that every sensor returns the same value when its dry \(0%\) and submerged to the water \(100%\).

User can recalibrate its sensor by using the same [calibration firmware](https://github.com/blavka/bcf-soil-sensor-calibration) we use.

### Soil Sensor Configuration

The capacitance chip inside Soil Sensor in configured during manufacturing to the capacitance ranges that are the most sensitive according to the conformal coating thickness.

User do not have to do the calibration. The capacitance chip can be configured over I2C during the first 50 ms after power-up. Because the Soil Sensor is using 1-Wire to I2C converter that has quite long start-up time, it is not possible to configure the chip over 1-Wire. It is only possible over I2C just before the sensor is coated.
