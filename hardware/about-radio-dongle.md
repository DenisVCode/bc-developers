# About Radio Dongle

![](../.gitbook/assets/_basics_module-overview_usb-dongle.png)

The **Radio Dongle** is the main element of the BigClown radio network. This product works as a **gateway for the BigClown nodes**. It looks like a USB stick. You can plug it to your desktop, Raspberry Pi, or Turris Omnia. Also, you can look at it as an access point for **up to 32 BigClown nodes**.
