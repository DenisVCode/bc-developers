# About Tag Module

![](../.gitbook/assets/_basics_module-overview_tag-module.png)

The **Tag Module** makes it possible to **connect up to six BigClow tags**. There are two independent I²C buses \(I2C0 and I2C1\) - one on each side. This allows to connect two tags of the same I²C address to a single BigClown node. It also features pull-up resistors on SDA/SCL signals of I2C1 bus.

Some BigClown modules already have one or more extra 5-pin sockets allowing you to connect a BigClown tag. But sometimes the number of positions is not enough, the socket is not available, or you need to extend the I²C bus with an additional channel. And that's when the **Tag Module** can help.
