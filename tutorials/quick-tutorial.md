# Quick Tutorial

{% hint style="info" %}
You can follow this tutorial even without Raspberry Pi. You just have to install [**BigClown Playground**](https://www.bigclown.com/doc/basics/quick-start-guide/) on your desktop. The Raspberry Pi approach is the easiest because you can download bc-rasbian image with pre-installed tools.
{% endhint %}

This document is a practical guide of using the **BigClown IoT Kit**. It will guide you how **Raspberry Pi** can read the temperature from **Core Module**, control the LED, measure the relative air humidity from **Humidity Tag**, control small electronic devices using **Relay Module**.

You will also be able to create a wireless network using **Radio Dongle**. Data acqusition and control process is demonstrated using **Node-RED**, a web application that will run inside the **Raspberry Pi**. This application allows intuitive graphical automation flow editing directly in your web browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you have **Radio Dongle** and **wireless kit**? If you would like to start creating you wireless network, you can later jump directly to the [**Creation of the wireless network chapter**](https://www.bigclown.com/doc/tutorials/raspberry-pi-tutorial/#creation-of-the-wireless-network) when you get the basic knowledge of **Gateway**, **`bcf` firmware flashing tool** and **Node-RED** in the chapters below.
{% endhint %}

First we will demonstrate basic functionality without a wireless network. We use just a single **Core Module** connected to the **Raspberry Pi** by a USB cable.

 What will we need at minimum:

* [Raspberry Pi](https://shop.bigclown.com/raspberry-pi-3-set) + [MicroSDHC Memory Card 8GB](https://shop.bigclown.com/microsdhc-card-8gb)
* [Core Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/core-module)

 Optionally for establishing a wireless network, you will need:

* [Radio Dongle](https://shop.bigclown.com/radio-dongle) \(or second one [Core Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/core-module)\)
* [Mini Battery Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/mini-battery-module)
* [Humidity Tag](https://shop.bigclown.com/humidity-tag) or [Climate Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/climate-module)
* [Relay Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/relay-module)
